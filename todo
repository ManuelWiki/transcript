- Have to add
    - addSynonym function
    - scan and translate functions
- Replace the type of LangSpec::patterns with std::set
    - To do so, I have to
    - Replace all calls to push_back with calls to insert
    - Make a class for comparison so it can be used as the argument the template argument Compare instead of std::less<Key>, as this function calls Key::operator<() and that function overload is missing for the std::function class
        - Make an overload as in the example in https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/set/set
